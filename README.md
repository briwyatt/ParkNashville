####  PARKNashville is a mobile-friendly web application that allows users to create & find parking information throughout the city of Nashville, Tennessee. The application is organized into several Nashville Areas that are commonly known as challenging to navigate and/or find parking. 

## How to Use:
ParkNashville is ideal for a user who already utilizes the GoogleMaps mobile application, as this app will take the exact geographic coordinates of a userâ€™s chosen parking spot and plug it in as a destination on GoogleMaps. ParkNashville, in short, allows the user to map to their actual intended destination: where they park their car.

## Front End Capstone Project:
#### ParkNashville is my first web application and was created as a capstone project during the Front-End portion of my cirriculum at Nashville Software School. [Capstone Presentation Notes](http://slides.com/briwyatt/deck-1#/)

## Technologies Used:
    - 90% JavaScript, 9.8% HTML, 0.5% CSS
    - AngularJS framework
    - Maps are created using GoogleMap's JavaScript v.3 API
    - Google's FireBase used for database storage.
